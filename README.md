This repository is presented for your amusement as I learn Vim.  If you want to
see how an expert configures Vim, you're looking in the wrong place.  There are
a [number][1] of [people][2] who [know a lot more than me][3] that have [public
repositories with their setups][4].

I'm making this public to give us some discussion points at our [Vim Geeks][5]
meetings, plus to make it more convenient to get to my own stuff.  If you happen
to find anything useful in here (as unlikely as that is), by all means please
use it however you like.

There will be things commented out, maybe because they didn't work, or because I
tried something and didn't like it.  I will try to add some comments about why
things didn't work when I think about it.

The various plugins that I'm using have dependencies.  On Fedora, they can be
met with the following:

  dnf install puppet rubygem-puppet-lint
